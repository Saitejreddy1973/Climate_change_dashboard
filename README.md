# Climate_change_dashboard
The project aims to analyze temperature changes across various countries over the past 60 years, transforming a scientific exploration into an interactive dashboard that highlights the connection between climate change and CO2 emissions. 

As climate change has increasingly entered the political discourse, understanding the scientific underpinnings of these changes has become essential. Our dashboard showcases comprehensive data visualizations that depict historical temperature fluctuations, allowing users to explore trends and patterns globally.

In addition to temperature data, the dashboard incorporates current demographics of each country, reflecting the socio-economic factors that influence CO2 emissions. This data includes metrics such as total population, urban population percentage, access to electricity, and other relevant indicators that contribute to a countryâ€™s carbon footprint.

The interactive nature of the dashboard enhances user engagement, enabling users to manipulate charts and view relationships between different datasets. As users examine temperature changes, they can simultaneously consider how demographics impact these trends, fostering a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between human activity and climate.

Each chart is designed to complement the others, allowing for comparative analysis across regions and time periods. This functionality is vital for visualizing the direct effects of CO2 emissions on temperature variations, providing insights into how demographic changes may exacerbate or mitigate these effects.

By highlighting the importance of demographics in environmental impact assessments, the dashboard serves as a valuable educational tool for policymakers, researchers, and the general public. Ultimately, this project aspires to contribute to the global conversation on climate change, emphasizing the urgent need for informed decision-making and collective action to combat its effects.
